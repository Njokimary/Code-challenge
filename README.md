## Project 1: Student Grade Generator

The first project in this repository is the Student Grade Generator. This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

- A > 79
- B > 60 to 79
- C > 49 to 59
- D > 40 to 49
- E > less than 40

Please refer to the project file [index.js] for the implementation.

## Project 2: Speed Detector

The second project in this repository is the Speed Detector. This program takes the speed of a car as input and determines the number of demerit points a driver receives based on the following rules:

- For speeds less than 70 km/s, it prints "Ok".
- For every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), the driver receives one demerit point.
- If the driver accumulates more than 12 demerit points, the program prints "License suspended".

Please refer to the project file [speedDetector.js] for the implementation.

## Project 3: Net Salary Calculator

The third project in this repository is the Net Salary Calculator. This program calculates the Payee Tax, NHIF, NSSF Deductions, and net salary based on the given inputs of basic salary and benefits of an employee.

Please refer to the project file [netCalculator.js] for the implementation.
